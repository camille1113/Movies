This example Java project demonstrates:

   Reading JSON data from a remote web-server using JSON and GSON libraries

   Using Map/HashMap to cache previously loaded films and person objects

   Specifying a user-agent when connecting to a remote server

   Creating a simple REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) to exercise the model

   Creating Junit4 tests to validate the JSON requests and validate the model
   e.g. A person appears in at least one movie
   e.g. If a person appeared in a film then the film should also list the person.

"Use the Source!"
